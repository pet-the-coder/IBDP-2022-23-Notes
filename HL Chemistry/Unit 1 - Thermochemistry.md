# Measuring Energy Changes

## Energy

Energy is basically the ability to do work

When mixing, if the solution does not dissolve properly â†’ water does not have enough kinetic enegy.

Thus, energy must be inputted into the system i.e hotplate.

# 3 Types of Systems

## Open System

A system where surroundings can influence system. Example: Open beaker.

`Anything can interfere with it (basically)`

### Closed System

    Things cannot get in but temperature can affect system. (just put a lid lol)
    Only affected by temperature changes

### Isolated System

    A closed system where no chemical substances can get in and temperature does not affect.

### Isolated systems are the preferred system! Syrofoam cups are godly.

# Enthalpy

A change in energy (J). A loss of heat or gain of heat.

`IN THE SYSTEM`

## Endothermic:

Positive enthalpy but loss of heat in the system
Ti > Tf

`Heat of the surroundings > system`

> - the system appears cold
> - energy from surroundings is absorbed in to the system to finish the reaction
> - <strong>$\triangle{}H > 0$</strong>

## Exothermic:

Negative enthalpy - gain of heat in the system
Tf > Ti

`Heat of the surroundings < system`

> - the system appears hot/hotter
> - energy is being released from the exothermic reaction to finish the reaction
> - <strong>$\triangle{}H < 0$</strong>

# Standard Conditions for Enthalpy

> $Q = mc\triangle{}T$
>
> $Q = mc(Tf - Ti)$

P = 100kPa

Concentration = 1.0u

Standard state

T = 298K

**Q** = heat energy (enthalpy)

**m** = mass (g)

**c** = specific heat capacity (Jg-1K-1)

**T** = temperature (K)

# Enthalpy Equation

> $\triangle{}H_{RxN (reaction)} = -\triangle{}H_{water}$
>
> $\triangle{}H = -mc\triangle{}T$

## Assumptions

1. volume of solution = Volume of $H_2O$. D = $1g/cm^3$ $\therefore$ mass = volume of solution

2. All of the heat goes from reaction to $H_2O$

3. No heat loss from system (`assume isolated system`)

### Example

Determine the molar enthalpy of combustion of butonal if 250 $cm^3$ of butanol is burned in excess oxygen. The heat from the alcohol is transferred to water. Initial temp is $22.1^\circ$ and fuel temp is $34.5^\circ$

> $\triangle{H}_{combustion} = -mc\triangle{T}$
>
> $= -(250g)(4.18Jg^{-1}K^{-1})(34.5-22.1)$
>
> $= -12958J$

Butanol: $C_4H_9OH$

Mass of Butanol:

> - $M = 74g/mol$
> - $n = \frac{m}{M} = \frac{250g}{74g/mol} = 3.378mol$

Find Enthalpy:

> - $\triangle{H} = \frac{Q}{n}$
> - $=-\frac{12958}{3.378mol}$
> - $=-3836J/mol$
> - $=-3.836J/atom$
