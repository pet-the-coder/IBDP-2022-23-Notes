## What is Entropy?

  Measure of `disorder/randomness`

- higher disorder &rarr; greater chance for `spontaneous reactions` &rarr; we like that
- more order &rarr; non-spontaneous reactions

order &rarr; disorder

> solid | liquid | gas

### Chemistry likes Higher Entropy

- less energy put in to create a reaction

- (depends on the requirement/question)

- `the more we need to manipulate something, the less we are able to control the results`

### Higher Entropy is also not good

- too much entropy `results in more biproducts` &rarr; randomness in results

## Entropy Symbol

- Entropy = $\triangle{S}\ units: Jmol^{-1}K^{-1}$
  > - if positive &rarr; disorder
  > - if negative &rarr; order

### When using Entropy

- we need to look at the entire system
- usually energy includes `Enthalpy, Entropy, and Gibb's (smth)`

---

- numbers are not necassary for entropy (sometimes)
- looking at the reaction we can determine the entropy

---

### Example (Mercury Liquid to Gas)

- $Hg_l$ &rarr; $Hg_g$
- $\triangle{S} = (+)$
- The liquid to gas transformation results in the mercury transitioning to a state of higher disorder

### Example (Carbon Dioxide Gas to Solid)

- $CO_{2g}$ &rarr; $CO_{2s}$
- $\triangle{S} = (-)$
- Gas to solid transition results in less energy and more order in solids than in gases

### Example (2 Gas &rarr; 1 gas)

- $N_{2g} + 2O_{2g}$ &rarr; $2NO_{2g}$
- $\triangle{S} = (-)$
- Two gasses to one gas results in less moles of total gas atoms and thus lowers the entropy because less chaos and movement in the product gas.

### Example (AQ solids &rarr; Precipitate)

- $2NaCl_{aq} + Pb(NO_3)_{2aq}$ &rarr; $PbCl_{2s} + 2NaNO_{3aq}$
- $\triangle{S} = (-)$
- two liquids coming together to form a solid and a liquid
- thus more order :(

### Example (2 Gas &rarr; 2 Gas)

- $CH_4 + 2O_2$ &rarr; $CO_2 + 2H_2O$

  > - $\triangle{S} = 0$

      or

- $C_2H_6 + \frac{7}{2}O_2$ &rarr; $2CO_2 + 3H_2O$
  > - $\triangle{S} = (+)$

---

## Entropy Values?

## `EVERYTHING | EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT HAS AN ` **_`ENTROPY VALUE`_** `|`

yea, tis a fact

---

### Example (Solid + Gas &rarr; Big Gas)

> $2C_s + 2H_{2g}$ &rarr; $C_2H_{4g}$

- - Carbon = GRAPHITE (unless specifically indicated)

> $\triangle{S} = 220 - [(2*5.7) + (2*130.7)]$
>
> $\triangle{S} = -52.8Jmol^-K^-$
>
> Therefore, entropy decreases and order increases. This makes sense becuase if we look at the equation, we have a `synthesis` equation which essentially lowers the amount of atoms and thus, lowers overall entropy

---

## Equation for Entropy

### $\triangle{S}_{total} = \triangle{S}_{system} + \triangle{S}_{surroundings}$

> noice

> ENTROPY is not related to just the reaction itself &dash; THERE must be MORE!!!
>
> What if the entropy of the surroundings is more ordered than the system? This will affect the entropy of the system, making **it** more ordered.

The surroundings affect the system but to a limited affect

---

### `Also related to` &rarr; $\triangle{S} = \sum{\triangle{S}_{products}} - \sum{\triangle{S}_{reactants}}$

SMOLL things will affect the overall picture

1. temperature of surroundings
2. entropy of system is just enthalpy basically $mc\triangle{T}$ (i think)
