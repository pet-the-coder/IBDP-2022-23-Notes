Nice equations

very cool

### Enthalpy Driven

![Enthalpy-Driven](images/1ofig2.png)

The flow of thermal energy provides most of the free energy in the reaction

- also `Exothermic` (releases heat)

### Entropy Driven

Increased disorder provides most of the reactions energy

- also `Endothermic` (absorbs heat)
