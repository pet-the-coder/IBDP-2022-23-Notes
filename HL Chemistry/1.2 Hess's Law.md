# Hess's Law

## Issues with certain reactions
In certain reactions, it is not possible to measure the change in temperature, for instance: `find temp change during combustion of Mg over fire`

    Therefore, Hess's Law lets us calculate for it?

## Simple Definition
A statement in chemistry: 

    the heat change in a chemical reaction is the same regardless of the number of stages in which the reaction is effected.


<!-- ## Example
Given a reaction between Mg and fire, the Mg will react to form MgO

`Desired Equation`
1. $Mg + \frac{1}{2}O_2 = MgO$

    - $\triangle{H} = -231.2kJ/mol$

`Given equations`

2. $MgO + 2HCl_{aq} = MgCl_2 + H_{2g}$

    - $\triangle{H} = -95kJ/mol$

3. $2H_2 + O_2 = MgO$
    
    - $\triangle{H} = -422kJ/mol$

## Example 2
`Desired Equation`

> $ClF + F_2 = ClF_3$

`given equations`
>1. $OF_2 = O_2 + 2F_2$
>       - $\triangle{H} = -49.4kJ/mol$
>2. $ClF+O_2 = Cl_2O + OF_2$
>       - $\triangle{H} = 205.6kJ/mol$
>3. $ClF_3 + O_2 = Cl_2O + OF_2$
>       - $\triangle{H} = 266.7kJ/mol$

`step 1 | reverse the first equation (initial?)`

enthalpy is based off the reaction. Certain molecules will affect and others will not.

[1] $2F_2 + O_2 = 2OF_2$
> $\triangle{H} = 98.8kJ/mol$
>
>not negative anymore bc we swapped/reversed equation

`basically balance out equations | like solving system of equations`

[2] $2ClF + O_2 = Cl_2O + OF_2$
> $\triangle{H} = 416.2kJ/mol$

[3] $Cl_2O + 3OF_2 = 2ClF_3 + 2O_2$
> $\triangle{H} = 533.4kJ/mol$

---

Final equation = [1] + [2] + [3]

[f] $2ClF + 2F_2 = 2ClF_3$
> $\triangle{H} = 845.8kJmol$
